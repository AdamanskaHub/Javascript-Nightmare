I'm the JS Lord. I've been observing you.

JS
You are a DISGRACE ! You barely have a grasp of Jquery. You don't even understand what a forEach loop is.
You still haven't understood what a function object is.

10
E 
Well, it's hard. I'm doing my best but...I'm doing fine with Jquery.
Look.

$('JSLord').css('border', '1px solid #bad455');

E
About to tell me why I'm here and, more importantly, how I get out.
Disgrace, hell, stuff like that.

JS
You should not take it so lightly... Heed my warning.

15
JS
This is your last chance to right your wrongs...

16
E
I did nothing wrong.

JS
Enough ! 
Can't you just focus and listen for two minutes?!

18
JS
This is probably why you can't get your head around function constructor.

E
That's mean...

20
JS
Follow the path to redemption. You will have to face three trials. Succeed in all of them and I will release you. Fail and you will be stuck here forever.

E 
It's not *that* bad here you know.

22
JS
And you will spend your days debugging

Ok ok... Let's not succomb to panic.
